Due to the size of the code project (~3GB) the code is being submitted via OneDrive instead of as a .zip folder. The shared folder can be accessed here:

Alternatively, the GitHub repo can be accessed here:

The project consists of a Unity project - the actual code created throughout the project can be found in the Assets/Scripts folder. 
Within this, there is a Configs folder containing the parameters used by the scripts (e.g. the setup for the GA). These can be adjusted to test the project with an alternative population size, terrain etc.

If you have any questions about the code / any issues accessing it, please do not hesitate to contact me - jacobgeorgebrown@protonmail.com
